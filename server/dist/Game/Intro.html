                    Space Out is a simple space shooter game. You control your ship with your mouse cursor and shoot stuff. The enemies get progressively harder to kill so try to progress as far as you can. Upgrade your ship by clicking you left mouse button to pause and access the upgrade panel. Enjoy!
